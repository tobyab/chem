# mol — An Apple Watch App for the Periodic Table.

Ever wanted to view every element on the Periodic Table and all of its elements right from the over-priced computer sitting on your wrist? Me too! That's why I made mol; a tiny app, for your watch which lets you do exactly that!

This was originally made for the 2024 Student Swift Challenge, but I was an idiot and didn't use Swift Playgrounds. Here's the iOS version that I submitted: [tobyab/ssc24](https://github.com/tobyab/ssc24). I'll combine the two repos together at some point.
